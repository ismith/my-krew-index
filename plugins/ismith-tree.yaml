  shortDescription: Show a tree of object hierarchies through ownerReferences
  description: |
    This plugin shows sub-resources of a specified Kubernetes API object in a
    tree view in the command-line. The parent-child relationship is discovered
    using ownerReferences on the child object.
  caveats: |
    * For resources that are not in default namespace, currently you must
      specify -n/--namespace explicitly (the current namespace setting is not
      yet used).
